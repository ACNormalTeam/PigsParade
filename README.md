## Snake

It's a conceptual game developed to mimic the "Snake" gameplay.

This project it's result of a challenge to develop an application with a very short timeline to test our java language knowledge, using a proprietary library called "[Simple Graphics Lib](https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics)" developed by the "Academia de CÃ³digo".


### What we did so far:

1. Create a github organization and repository;
2. Add .gitignore and README.md;
3. Initialize the Intellij Project;
